## Description

- This is a JavaScript challenge - I created a password generator for employeers to use before accessing sensitive data. The goal was to make a randomly generator password, 
- The motivation to create better security and flexibility for clients by providing customisable length and character type options. The result would allow clients to have stronger passwords with greater security.
- As a result of building this product I develop skills in writing javascript, namely working with loops, arrays and certain built-in methods like Math.Floor & Math Random, charAt, and just writing functions in general.
- It was very challenging at first, but I honed my 'googling' skills and found some resources online and via youtube. I followed a tutorial to built a random password generator and 'dummy' fit it to the html & css. A proud moment. I will still left the the seeming insurmountable hurdle of developing prompts and validation checks to fulfill the customisable character type and length criteria. 
- I was able to overcome this challenge with some 1:1 tutoring and this made all the difference. I used charAt instead of .substring() to pair random numbers with individual letters. I also learned how to force extract chars from individual strings to ensure at least one character would be used per array or dataset. 
- I will continue to practice functions, loops, and exploring built-in methods to know what options I have and to keep improving on writing more concise code!
